"Frankly, Mr. Shankly, this position I've held,",It pays my way and it corrodes my soul
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?,Is this just fantasy?
I would say I'm sorry,If I thought that it would change your mind
vous avez lu l'histoire de jesse james,comment il vicut comment il est mort
Like a cloud his fingers explode,"On the typewriter ribbon, the shadow grows"
"Give me your weight, I'm solid","Hold me up, I'm falling down"
She's got a smile that it seems to me,Reminds me of childhood memories
Confidence is a preference for the habitual voyeur,Of what is known as
We begin again,We knew before it happened
Seymour Stein,I've been lonely
Oh yeah!,Oh yeah!
I'm a little lost without you,That could be an understatement
"My, my, my, my now",You're on my mind now
It's such a pleasure to touch your skin,to touch your skin
Our hearts are free,So tell me what's wrong with the feeling
A man in my shoes runs a light,And all the papers lied tonight
Divide your cultured pearls and paste,I'm looking for to lay your waste
Remember when you held my hand?,"So, you remember when you were my man?"
Feel good,Feel good
And you know it's time to go,Through the sleet and driving snow
"The birds, they sing at the break of day","Start again, I heard them say"
With rocks in my dress,And smoke in my hair
Craze my hair and shine my shoes,And kiss the kiss that I could lose
You do something to me,Something that simply mystifies me
Candy,She's sweet like candy in my veins
Higher,You take me higher
Yesterday I got so old,I felt like I could die
It glittered and it gleamed,For the arriving beauty queen
"One, two, three, four",When you move in right up close to me
Some folks like water,Some folks like wine
What's in my head?,It's where we lived
"Well, I was dancing at a night club one Friday night",And that night club bar was a little uptight
Ice baby,I saw your girlfriend and she was
Nightswimming deserves a quest night,The photograph on the dashboard taken years ago
"You told me, ""I see the rise""",But it always falls
It's the end of the year,I have just settled here
"Well, you didn't wake up this morning 'cause you didn't go to bed",You were watching the whites of your eyes turn red
There's a rhythm in rush these days,Where the lights don't move and the colors don't fade
"Hello, is there anybody in there?",Just nod if you can hear me
"At first, I was afraid, I was petrified",I kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
I'd swim across Lake Michigan,I'd sell my shoes
"Grey light, new day, leaks through the window",An old soul song comes on the alarm clock radio
Why am I standing on a cloud,Every time you're around
"We're not scared to lose it all, security thrown through the wall",Future dreams we have to realize
My body breaks,And the body is fine
I've been so many places in my life and time,I've sung a lot of songs
"Baby, give it all",I'd give it all just to make you mine
A girl consumed by fire,We all know her desire
Well it's got nothing to do with anything that is real,You just believe in it and it's true
And you thought I was just holding on ,To the past
